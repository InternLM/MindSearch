## ‚ú® MindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits Deep AI Searcher

MindSearch is an open-source AI Search Engine Framework with Perplexity.ai Pro performance. You can simply deploy it with your own perplexity.ai style search engine with either close-source LLMs (GPT, Claude) or open-source LLMs ([InternLM2.5 series](https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm2_5-7b-chat) are specifically optimized to provide superior performance within the MindSearch framework; other open-source models have not been specifically tested). It owns following features:

- ü§î **Ask everything you want to know**: MindSearch is designed to solve any question in your life and use web knowledge.
- üìö **In-depth Knowledge Discovery**: MindSearch browses hundreds of web pages to answer your question, providing deeper and wider knowledge base answer.
- üîç **Detailed Solution Path**: MindSearch exposes all details, allowing users to check everything they want. This greatly improves the credibility of its final response as well as usability.
- üíª **Optimized UI Experience**: Providing all kinds of interfaces for users, including React, Gradio, Streamlit and Terminal. Choose any type based on your need.
- üß† **Dynamic Graph Construction Process**: MindSearch decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è MindSearch vs other AI Search Engines

Comparison on human preference based on depth, breadth, factuality of the response generated by ChatGPT-Web, Perplexity.ai (Pro), and MindSearch. Results are obtained on 100 human-crafted real-world questions and evaluated by 5 human experts\*.

## ‚öΩÔ∏è Build Your Own MindSearch

### Step1: Dependencies Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InternLM/MindSearch
cd MindSearch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step2: Setup MindSearch API

Setup FastAPI Server.

```bash
python -m mindsearch.app --lang en --model_format internlm_server --search_engine DuckDuckGoSearch
```

- `--lang`: language of the model, `en` for English and `cn` for Chinese.
- `--model_format`: format of the model.
  - `internlm_server` for InternLM2.5-7b-chat with local server. (InternLM2.5-7b-chat has been better optimized for Chinese.)
  - `gpt4` for GPT4.
    if you want to use other models, please modify [models](./mindsearch/agent/models.py)
- `--search_engine`: Search engine.
  - `DuckDuckGoSearch` for search engine for DuckDuckGo.
  - `BingSearch` for Bing search engine.

### Step3: Setup MindSearch Frontend

Providing following frontend interfaces,

- React

```bash
# Install Node.js and npm
# for Ubuntu
sudo apt install nodejs npm

# for windows
# download from https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/download/prebuilt-installer

# Install dependencies

cd frontend/React
npm install
npm start
```

Details can be found in [React](./frontend/React/README.md)

- Gradio

```bash
python frontend/mindsearch_gradio.py
```

- Streamlit

```bash
streamlit run frontend/mindsearch_streamlit.py
```

## üåê Change Web Search API

To use a different type of web search API, modify the `searcher_type` attribute in the `searcher_cfg` located in `mindsearch/agent/__init__.py`. Currently supported web search APIs include:

- `GoogleSearch`
- `DuckDuckGoSearch`
- `BraveSearch`
- `BingSearch`

For example, to change to the Brave Search API, you would configure it as follows:

```python
BingBrowser(
    searcher_type='BraveSearch',
    topk=2,
    api_key=os.environ.get('BRAVE_API_KEY', 'YOUR BRAVE API')
)
```

## üêû Debug Locally

```bash
python -m mindsearch.terminal
```
