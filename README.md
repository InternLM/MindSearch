## ✨ MindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits Deep AI Searcher

MindSearch is an open-source AI Search Engine Framework with Perplexity.ai Pro performance. You can simply deploy it with your own perplexity.ai style search engine with either close-source LLMs (GPT, Claude) or open-source LLMs (InternLM2.5-7b-chat). It owns following features:

- 🤔 **Ask everything you want to know**: MindSearch is designed to solve any question in your life and use web knowledge.
- 📚 **In-depth Knowledge Discovery**: MindSearch browses hundreds of web pages to answer your question, providing deeper and wider knowledge base answer.
- 🔍 **Detailed Solution Path**: MindSearch exposes all details, allowing users to check everything they want. This greatly improves the credibility of its final response as well as usability.
- 💻 **Optimized UI Experimence**: Providing all kinds of interfaces for users, including React, Gradio, Streamlit and Terminal. Choose any type based on your need.
- 🧠 **Dynamic Graph Construction Process**: MindSearch decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher.

## ⚽️ Build Your Own MindSearch

### Step1: Dependencies Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InternLM/MindSearch
cd MindSearch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step2: Setup MindSearch API

Setup FastAPI Server.

```bash
python -m mindsearch.app --lang en --model_format internlm_server
```

- `--lang`: language of the model, `en` for English and `cn` for Chinese.
- `--model_format`: format of the model.
  - `internlm_server` for InternLM2.5-7b-chat with local server. (InternLM2.5-7b-chat has been better optimized for Chinese.)
  - `gpt4` for GPT4.
    if you want to use other models, please modify [models](./mindsearch/agent/models.py)

### Step3: Setup MindSearch Frontend

Providing following frontend interfaces,

- React

```bash
# Install Node.js and npm
# for Ubuntu
sudo apt install nodejs npm

# for windows
# download from https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/download/prebuilt-installer

# Install dependencies

cd frontend/React
npm install
npm start
```

Details can be found in [React](./frontend/React/README.md)

- Gradio

```bash
python frontend/mindsearch_gradio.py
```

- Streamlit

```bash
streamlit run frontend/mindsearch_streamlit.py
```

## 🐞 Debug Locally

```bash
python -m mindsearch.terminal
```
