    # GPU support explanation:
    # The current configuration has been tested with NVIDIA GPUs. If you use other types of GPUs, you may need to adjust the configuration.
    # For AMD GPUs, you can try using the ROCm driver by modifying the configuration as follows:
    # deploy:
    #   resources:
    #     reservations:
    #       devices:
    #         - driver: amd
    #           count: 1
    #           capabilities: [gpu]
    #
    # For other GPU types, you may need to consult the respective Docker GPU support documentation.
    # In theory, any GPU supported by PyTorch should be configurable here.
    # If you encounter issues, try the following steps:
    # 1. Ensure the correct GPU drivers are installed on the host
    # 2. Check if your Docker version supports your GPU type
    # 3. Install necessary GPU-related libraries in the Dockerfile
    # 4. Adjust the deploy configuration here to match your GPU type
    #
    # Note: After changing GPU configuration, you may need to rebuild the image.
